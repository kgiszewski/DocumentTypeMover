# DocumentTypeMover

An Umbraco plugin that adds Document Type move functionality to the version 7 backoffice.

At present, it is safe to move a document type 'down' as a child of an existing sibling.  This facilitates that type of move.

Perhaps additional functionality can be added later.

##Build
Open project and build the DLL.

Merge the `/App_Plugins` directory with your main Umbraco's plugin folder.

If popular enough, I can create an installable package.
